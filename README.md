# Genetic Algorithm String Evolution

The application has been written in Python 3.x and has been tested to work with v3.5, v3.6 and v3.7.
Significant performance improvements (4x faster) have been found while using PyPy (v6.0 that uses Python 3.5) as the interpreter compared to the default CPython.
 
To run extract the four Python source files.
The main.py is the module to run as it contains the main method and it is where all the parameters can be set for Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing and Random Search runs.
 
The main.py file should be run like this:
python3 main.py
